# Predict Heart Disease Project

The goal of this project is to predict patients who have heart disease from a number of clinical variables when they show up at the clinic/hospital with chest pain.

## Hypothesis

Patients can be stratified into different risks groups for heart disease based on clinical variables. 

## Data

I have a dataset of clinical variables and heart disease outcomes for 303 patients. 

## Methodology

I will train a random forest model on a subset of my dataset (training cohort). I will then assess the model by measuring its classification error rate on the remainder of the dataset (test cohort).
